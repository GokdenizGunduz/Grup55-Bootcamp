### Product Description
ThinkFirst is an innovative AI learning platform designed to enhance analytical thinking skills in children and young adults. Unlike traditional AI assistants, it employs the Socratic method to encourage users to think critically rather than providing direct answers. The platform asks age-appropriate questions tailored to the user's knowledge level, helping them reach solutions independently. This approach promotes active learning and problem-solving skills instead of passive information consumption.

While ThinkFirst appears to be an educational project, it also has significant positive impacts in the healthcare domain alongside education. By preventing young people and children from reaching direct answers, it aims to prevent mental health issues such as cognitive decline and memory problems. The platform encourages active brain engagement, which is crucial for maintaining cognitive health and preventing the deterioration of thinking abilities that can result from over-reliance on instant information access.

### Product Features

**Socratic Inquiry Engine:**
Utilizes Gemini API to guide users through thought-provoking questions and hints rather than providing direct answers.

**Age Group Adaptation:**
Provides interaction with appropriate language and complexity levels based on user's age and educational level.

**Interactive Dialog System:**
Creates a dynamic conversation environment offering step-by-step learning experiences.

**Multi-Subject Support:**
Offers assistance across various subjects including mathematics, science, social studies, and language learning.

**Gamification Elements:**
Daily question counter tracks and limits user interactions, encouraging consistent but measured usage. This feature is synchronized with Firebase Realtime Database to maintain usage statistics across sessions.

### Target Audience
ThinkFirst's target audience consists of students aged 8-18 and their parents. Specifically:
- Families wanting to develop their children's analytical thinking skills
- Students who prefer understanding over memorization while doing homework
- Teachers who support technology use in education
- Parents who want their children to use screen time productively

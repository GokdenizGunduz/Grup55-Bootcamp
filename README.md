### Product Description
ThinkFirst is an innovative AI learning platform designed to enhance analytical thinking skills in children and young adults. Unlike traditional AI assistants, it employs the Socratic method to encourage users to think critically rather than providing direct answers. The platform asks age-appropriate questions tailored to the user's knowledge level, helping them reach solutions independently. This approach promotes active learning and problem-solving skills instead of passive information consumption.

While ThinkFirst appears to be an educational project, it also has significant positive impacts in the healthcare domain alongside education. By preventing young people and children from reaching direct answers, it aims to prevent mental health issues such as cognitive decline and memory problems. The platform encourages active brain engagement, which is crucial for maintaining cognitive health and preventing the deterioration of thinking abilities that can result from over-reliance on instant information access.

### Product Features
